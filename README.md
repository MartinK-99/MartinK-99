ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MartinK-99 or just Martin

I'm interested in mathematics or more specifically numerical analysis like solving differential equations with numerical algorithms.
Crazy stuff, I know.
My favorite programming language is HTML... No it's not. Python is my favorite and I'm learning a bit of Julia
which I think is a pretty good programming language since it is very readable and extremely fast.
I have coded in C++ but damn... It's so diverse and often too complicated for me.

For me GitHub is just a way to archive my code. I don't plan on really hosting anything on here.
Is this enough of an introduction? I hope so.

Anyway, take a look around and happy coding :)
